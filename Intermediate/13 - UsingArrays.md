# 13 - Using Arrays
Research how to use `random.choice()` from the `random` **library**.

You are going to create a random character generator, to help inspire a game developer who is stuck for ideas of who the main character should be in their latest big game.

The idea is that each time the program is run, a random character will be presented to the user. You can use your imagination as much as you like here, but here is an example of what the output of your program might look like. 

```
>> Name: Steve Crennel
>> Nickname: Sparky
>> Gender: Female
>> Born: Australia
>> Date of Birth: 24/07/1987
>> Current Age: 33
>> Current Location: India
>> Occupation: Electrician
>> Hobby: Archery
>> Height: 186cm
>> Eye colour: Green
>> Family: A Wife called Karen
>> Special Skill: Negotiation
```

Your program will be successful if you can run it multiple times in a row and get completely different characters generated. 

Use as many different characteristics as you want to make interesting and diverse characters, you can take ones I have used in the above example, as well as adding your own.

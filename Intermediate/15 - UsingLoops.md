# 15 - Using Loops

You are going to create a program that has the following menu:

```
>> Welcome to vowel counter!
>> 1) Count vowels
>> 2) Exit
>> Please enter the number of your choice: 
>>
```

You are going to create a function that runs whenever the user chooses option 1.
The function will ask the user to enter a word or a phrase. It will then count all the vowels in that word. It will display that number to the user in a clear and friendly way. 

Once the user has been given the total amount of vowels in their word, they will then be given the main menu, as shown above, where they can choose to Count vowels again, or Exit the program. 

The program should be able to run continously until the user chooses to exit.

# 1 - Hello World
*Skills: Variables, Strings, Output*

Hello

Welcome to Python!

I know you're dying to get started, so let's jump right in.

## The Basics
This is a *string*:
`"Hello World"`
A string is anything that is surrounded by `"speech marks"`, or `'quote marks'`.

`my_string = "Hello World"`
We have assigned the above string to a **variable** called: `my_string`
We could have called it anything...

This is another string, but the **variable** name doesn't really tell us much about what we should expect it to contain
`cute_elephant = "Hello World"`

**Variable** names always go on the left of the equals sign. The value of the **variable** always goes on the right hand side of the equals sign.  

Think of a **variable** like a cup. We can store things in it, and we can even throw out what is in the cup and put something different in it. That's why we call them **variables**, because what is inside them can vary over the course of our program. 

## 1.1
In the file called `main.py`, make a **variable** called `my_string` and set its value to `"Hello World"`

## 1.2
We can get python to tell us what the value is of a **variable** by using the `print()` command
Inside the brackets `()`, we put the value we want to be displayed to us
Type the `print()` command in `main.py` and in the brackets, enter `Hello World` as a **string**. 

## 1.3
It is much more common to use a **variable**, and `print()` that instead
Do the same thing you did in the step above, but this time, put just the **variable** name in the brackets `()` of the `print()` command.

## The Big Finish
Run your code *(Big run button, top middle of the screen)*
If successful, you should have `Hello World` print out two times, and you programmed it to happen in *two* different ways (look at you go!). 

A `"Hello World"` program is a common starting place for new programmers - you have just taken your first step towards becoming a programmer.

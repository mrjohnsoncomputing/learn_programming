<!-- Title: 1 - Hello World.py -->
<!-- Skills: Tags -->

<!-- Hello! The four characters at the start of the line tells the computer to ignore this, all the way until the little arrow at the end (down on line 7).
We refer to these lines that the computer ignores as "Comments"
We can use comments in our code to explain what is going on, so that other people who look at our code can understand more easily. 
We might also use comments to make notes to ourselves -->


<!-- This is a tag:
<p>Hello World</p>
Tags are what we use in HTML in order to tell our web browser what kind of content something is. 
For example: -->
<p>Hello, this is a paragraph tag in action!</p>
<p>Notice how there is a line between us? That is because we defined the above line as a paragraph, and we defined this as a separate paragraph, by using the p tags </p>

<!-- This is what that same content looks like if we don't use tags: -->
Hello, this is a paragraph tag in action!


Notice how there is no line between us? That is because these lines have not been defined as anything, so the computer just prints this out one after the other.

<!-- Notice how the line spacing in the code above doesn't actually appear when you look at the finished result - its all just one long sentence!
We must use tags in HTML to define how we want our content to be structured. The computer doesn't care how your code looks, it only cares about the tags you use. 

We CAN add in extra balnk lines by using the Line Break tag <br>.
Most tags need a start and a end tag, like the p tag above has both a start: <p> and an end: </p> to show where the paragraph starts and ends.
The <br> tag doesn't need an end tag, as it doesn't need to surround any text - it is just telling the computer to move onto a new line.

TRY THIS!
Try inserting a couple of <br> tags in between the two <p> tags above. Does it make a difference if both <br> tags are on the same line? -->

# Title: 2 - Numbers.py
# Skills: Variables, Integers, Math, Output

# Now that we have learnt how to print an output to the screen, let us do something useful with it.
# We can use variables to store the result of a calculation like so:
# result = 1 + 1
# In the space below, create an appropriately named variable and set its value to the calculation 300 divided by 19
# In programming the forward slash character "/" is used to represent divide, and the asterix character "*" is used to represent multiply.

# v 2.1 - Code v #

### ^^^^^^^^^^ ###

# Now you can use the print() command to output the result of this calculation, remembering to put the variable name in the brackets of the print function.
# Do this in the space below

# v 2.2 - Code v #

### ^^^^^^^^^^ ###

# Numbers in programming can fall into many different categories, but keeping it simple we have Integer (int) and Floating Point (float).
# An integer represents a whole number, and a floating point number represents any number with a decimal point, even things such as 10.0
# The way a computer stores and performs calclations on an integer is different to that of a float, and so it is important we understand the difference.
# What number type is the result from 2.2?
# Type your answer as a string in the print() command in the space below.

# v 2.3 - Code v #

### ^^^^^^^^^^ ###

# We can convert one type of number to another. Putting a float inside the brackets of int() will convert our float into an integer.
# Try updating the code you wrote in 2.2 to have the answer print out as an integer rather than a decimal.
# If you get stuck, read the next section for the answer. 

# v 2.4 - Code v #

### ^^^^^^^^^^ ###

# Lets break down the code for the solution for the last section.
# Your answer should have looked like this print(int(result)) [Your variable name might not be result, that's fine!]
# The way the computer will execute this code will be to first take whatever is inside of the brackets of print and resolve it.
# In order to resolve what is in the brackets, it performs the conversion from the command, int(result)
# The result of this is then printed.
# As a final activity, create an appropriately named variable and assign it to this calculation: 4 + 4 * 8
# Print the variable so that you can see what the result is.
# Before running the code, predict what the answer will be. 

# v 2.5 - Code v #

### ^^^^^^^^^^ ###

# What mathemathical principle is the computer following?
# How might you use brackets () in the calculation in order to get the result of 64 printing to the screen?

# v 2.6 - Code v #

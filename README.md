# Learn Python
Welcome to this series of lessons which aim to take you from no knowledge of programming and guide you through a series of enjoyable activities to develop your skills and understanding. 

It is important that you stick with it and read everything carefully, because as you go through the tasks, you will have to solve problems with a lot less guidance than you get in the earlier files. 

I hope you enjoy this, and if you have any feedback on any of the activities please let me know. 

## Getting Started
Click on `1-Hello World.md` to get started. (On the left)

All activities where you have to write code will take place inside the `main.py` file, unless otherwise stated.

## Attitude
The idea behind these tasks is for you to be self-motivated to explore, try out new things and not worry about getting things perfect the first time round. 

It is down to you to put in the effort, and I think that you will easily get out whatever you put into this. 

**Happy coding!**

# Title: Elif.py
# Skills: 

# We are going to build on what we know about selection, by adding more conditions. 
# Let us consider this scenario: 
# We have a program which asks the user for their name
# A user called Bob should be greeted by the program saying "Hello Bob"
# A user called Sharon should be greeted by the program saying "Oh hi Sharon!"
# A user called Dr. Evil should be greeted by the program saying "Unauthorised access!"
# A user called Derek should be greeted by the program saying "Welcome boss."
# Any other user should be greeted by "Successful log on"

# In order to implement that, we need more conditions, and that is where elif comes in.
# Look at the code below, see how I have laid out my if statement. 
# In this, I am testing four conditions, and if nothing matches any of those conditions, we shall end up in the else section.
# "elif", if you haven't figured it out already, is short for "else if".

# v 7.1 - Code v #
if CONDITION:
    # print something here I guess...  
elif CONDITION:
    # print something different here I guess...
elif CONDITION:
    # print something else here I guess
elif CONDITION:
    # print unique string here I guess...
else:
    # print generic greeting
### ^^^^^^^^^^ ###

# In the code above, add user input, replace the conditions and insert the correct print statement for each user.
# Remeber to get your single equals and double equals signs round the right way!

# Hello! The Hash symbol at the start of the line tells the computer to ignore this.
# We refer to these lines that the computer ignores as "Comments"
# We can use comments in our code to explain what is going on, so that other people who look at our code can understand more easily. 
# We might also use comments to make notes to ourselves


# This is a string:
# "Hello World"
# A string is anything that is surrounded by "speech marks", or 'quote marks'.

# my_string = "Hello World"
# We have assigned this string to a variable called: my_string
# We could have called it anything

# This is another string, but the variable name doesn't really tell us much about what we should expect it to contain
# cute_elephant = "Hello World"

# We can get python to tell us what the value is of a variable by using the print() command
# Inside the brackets, we put the value we want to be displayed to us
# Type the print() command in the space below and in the brackets, enter Hello World as a string. 



# It is much more common to use a variable, and print that instead
# Do the same thing you did in the step above, but this time, put just the variable name in the brackets of the print() command.

# A library, or module, is a file of code that you can load into your project in order to access extra commands which have been written by other people. 
# Commands such as print(), input(), int() and str() as we have seen already come as standard in python, as they are common to almost all programming projects.
# However, some commands are not always neccessary, and to save loading all of this code when you run your program...
# ...these commands are kept separate for you to import as and when you need to.

# Lets import our first library - the time library. 
# To do this, we can use the line: import time
# Add that in the space below

# Create a program which does the following:
# Asks the user for their dog's name, and asks the user for their dog's age in human years. Return to the user the age of their dog in dog years. 
# Calculating this is actually a bit more complex than it was once thought, but for the sake of this problem we are going to...
# ...keep things simple and use 1 human year = 7 dog years.

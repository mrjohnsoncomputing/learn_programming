I would like you to take what you have learnt so far on your journey into programming and try to solve this problem.

Create a program which does the following:
- Asks the user for their dog's name
- Asks the user for their dog's age in human years. 
- Return to the user the age of their dog in dog years. 

Calculating this is actually a bit more complex than it was once thought, but for the sake of this problem we are going to keep things simple and use the following rule:

1 human year = 7 dog years. 

Your program should look a bit like this when you run it:

```Python
> Hello! Welcome to my dog age calculator!
> What's the name of your good girl/boy? 
>> Captain Woof
> And how old is Captain Woof in human years?
>> 7
> That would make Captain Woof 49 in dog years!
> Thanks for using my dog age calculator - have a lovely day. 
```
